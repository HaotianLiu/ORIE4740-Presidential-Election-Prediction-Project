### Project Proposal

What types of issues people care more about in this election? Will they come out to vote? Which candidate people are in favor of? Are they voting because they strongly love a candidate, or strongly despise the other? Who do they think will win?

For years, polls have attempted to capture the capricious mood of the general public and create a faithful representation of people's opinions about presidential elections. Now, fortunately, people are recording their opinions and saving them une masse in social media. However, due to the formidable quanitity and messy forms of the data, traditional statistical tools no longer serves well, and this is where machine learning comes in.

We are planning to take advantage of the Twitter API tool, which allows developers to search for certain terms and download related tweets as well as relavent information (time of the tweet, type of phone used, location of the tweet, etc). The API allows us to access a chunk of expressed opinions regarding a given issue.

We will explore machine learning tools in analyzing the tweets regarding 2016 presidential election, and attempt to answer one or all of the questions proposed in the begining.
